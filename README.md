This is a project i've stored locally for a longer period of time and recently decided to move onto git.

The project aims to automatically complete the google snake game at https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade by using pyautogui to read the game state via screenshots. The project is however old and has not seen a lot of updates recently, but was mostly put up so i can store some of my projects on github and be able to access them locally on various computers, a recent initiative.
